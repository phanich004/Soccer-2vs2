# Soccer Agents with A2C Implementation

This repository contains reinforcement learning agents trained for a Unity ML-Agents soccer simulation using the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm. The provided Unity environment, `SoccerTwos.app`, simulates a 2v2 soccer scenario.

## Files Overview
- **1striker.py**: Trains a single striker agent.
- **2v2_stationary.py**: Trains a 2v2 soccer game with stationary opponents.
- **2v2_random.py**: Trains a 2v2 soccer game with randomly moving opponents.
